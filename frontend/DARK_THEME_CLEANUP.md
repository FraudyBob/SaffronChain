## 📝 Notes

### **Lint Warnings**
The `@tailwind` warnings in `globals.css` are **expected and safe to ignore**. These are Tailwind CSS directives that the linter doesn't recognize, but they work correctly.

### **Color Tokens**
The HSL color tokens in `globals.css` now properly support both light and dark modes:
- Light mode tokens are defined in `:root`
- Dark mode tokens override them in `.dark`
- Components use these tokens via Tailwind classes

### **Future Updates**
When adding new cards or modals, use the patterns documented above to maintain consistency.
